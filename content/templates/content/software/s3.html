        Sudoku is a fine example of a complex mathematical puzzle.
        The generalisation of Sudoku to a puzzle with \(n\) symbols as
        opposed to 9 leads to an NP-complete problem, an example of
        a class of exceedingly challenging problems.
</p>
<p>
        Solving these in general can utilise many techniques, but the
        fact that this issue is NP-complete suggests that little gain
        can be made on simple brute force methods. This deduction led
        to an ability to concentrate on user experience rather than
        technicalities when building an automated solver.

        The Android app demonstrated in the link below implements
        image processing and OCR to create automated puzzle recognition
        to give it an edge over other solvers that could never truly
        improve over a brute force method.
