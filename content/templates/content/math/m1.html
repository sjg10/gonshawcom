	<h2>Group Theory</h2>
</header>
<p>
	A group is the abstract notion of symmetry,
	and to me one of the most stunning ideas in mathematics.
	It was initially concieved as an abstraction and generalisation
	of symmetry of equations, that is after asking how can I switch
	numbers in an given equation around and still get the same answer,
	we take the collection of all switchings, this being a group.
</p>
<p>
	On generalising this by focusing on the defining properties of these
	switchings, the mathematician Galois discovered alongside his colleagues
	that a whole field of worthy study can grow out of these objects.
	It turned out that the generalisation captured the idea of symmetry
	perfectly, and any mathematical discussion of symmetry in any area
	will use the language of groups.
</p>
<p>
	I am currently looking into certain groups that describe symmetries
	of shapes lying in a kind of space that has only a small number of
	places where one can stand. These are the classical groups, and they
	generate many other collections of symmetries.
