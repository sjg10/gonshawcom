	<h2>Mutations of Fake Weighted Projective Space</h2>
</header>
<p>
	The Fano search is an ongoing project at Imperial
	College London to classify the family of shapes
	known as Fano varieties. These shapes have great
	significance to geometry as well as current physical
	theories.
</p>
<p>
	Classifying these shapes is exceedingly challenging,
	and the method has taken the form of studying
	associated objects known as Laurent polynomials.
	Unfortunately, multiple Laurent polynomials are associated
	to a single Fano variety, yet it is conjectured that these
	polynomials are all related by a process known as mutation.
</p>
<p>
	I had the pleasure to work alongside the group studying
	the effect of mutation on a class of objects known as
	fake weighted projective spaces. Our results are collated in
	the paper below.
