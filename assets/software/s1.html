<p>
	There are many different extant software packages catering
	to abstract mathematical computation. These include GAP,
	MAGMA, Cayley, Maple and R to name a few. This gives rise
	to a number of issues. Each cater to a specific purpose, and
	integration is lacking. In addition the licensing governing the
	various packages is complex which often leads to
	great financial costs to academic institutions.
</p>
<p>
	SAGE is an open-source, free, Cython based Python syntax
	wrapper and program that provides access to effectively all
	the free packages, and allows intergration of paid ones.
	It additionally incorporates new methods not included in other
	packages allowing for new ways of tackling old problems.

<p>
	I have <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/query?author=~Samuel+Gonshaw">contributed</a>
	 a native implementation of polytope normal
	form calculation, that is functions that take certain geometric
	objects and can test for similarity. The project is ongoing and
	always looking for more contributions.
